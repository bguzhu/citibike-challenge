# Analysis

Dashboard 1:

An interesting discovery from the first dashboard is the number of start and end stations are confined to the New Jersey area rather than spread out across the United States. This is the largest bike-sharing program in the US so it should have more stations in other states. The reason why this can be occurring is that this program began in 2013 and has only experienced some growth possibly due to a small population interested in biking.

Dashboard 2:

The unexpected phenomenon occurring in the second dashboard is that there is a sudden increase in the average trip duration for birth years of 1993 to 1995 followed by a quick drop to 1997. This can happen because there are more bikers born in 1993-1995 that are annual subscribers than those born in 1996-1997. Annual subscribers should have more access to the bike-sharing program and are able to bike for a longer duration compared to short-term users.

# Map write-up

Trends noticed for creating the map are that the start and end stations appear to be expanding from the top to the bottom and from left to right for the state of New Jersey. The location and the number of stations indicate how the bike station distribution is developing.
